# Above the Fold Tracker – WordPress Plugin

![Plugin Banner](assets/banner-1544x500.png)
*(You can customize this banner if you wish)*

## Born from a Real Need

This plugin wasn't built for show, or as a throwaway coding exercise. It was born from a simple but persistent question: What do users really see first? And more importantly—what do they *do* in those first seconds?

The area above the fold, that first visible screen before scrolling, is often where the decision happens—to engage or to bounce. Above the Fold Tracker was created to track those critical interactions in that very moment. It records which links are actually *visible*, captures the ones that get clicked, stores them with screen size and timestamp, and sends everything cleanly through a REST API. The codebase is simple, testable, and ready to grow.

## Core Features

* Detects and tracks clicks on links *visible on page load*
* Records detailed context: URL, screen resolution, timestamp
* Automatically purges old data to keep things light
* REST API endpoint for structured data submission
* Admin analysis dashboard (coming soon – it’s in progress)

## Installation

### Standard WordPress method:

1. Download the latest release from GitHub
2. Go to **Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin**
3. Select the `.zip` file
4. Activate "Above the Fold Tracker"

### Developer-friendly way:

```bash
cd wp-content/plugins
git clone https://github.com/your-username/above-the-fold-tracker.git
composer install --no-dev
```

## How it Works

Once activated, the plugin silently creates the necessary database table and begins collecting data. No extra configuration needed. It immediately starts tracking link visibility and user clicks in the upper section of each page.

### API access

You can retrieve the data via a clean API:

**Endpoint:**
`POST /wp-json/abovefold/v1/track`

**Example payload:**

```json
{
  "screen": "1920x1080",
  "links": [
    {"url": "https://example.com/link1"},
    {"url": "https://example.com/link2"}
  ]
}
```

## Frontend Integration (Optional)

Here’s a sample script to track links if you want to manually wire it into your theme or head scripts:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const visibleLinks = document.querySelectorAll('a:not([href^="#"])');

  visibleLinks.forEach(link => {
    link.addEventListener('click', trackClick);
  });

  function trackClick() {
    const screen = `${window.screen.width}x${window.screen.height}`;
    const links = Array.from(visibleLinks).map(l => ({ url: l.href }));

    fetch('/wp-json/abovefold/v1/track', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'X-WP-Nonce': atfAdmin.nonce
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ screen, links })
    });
  }
});
```

This script only runs for non-logged-in users to ensure clean data.

## Customization

### Hooks and Filters

You can fine-tune or extend behavior like so:

```php
// Modify data before saving
add_filter('abovefold_tracking_data', function($data) {
    $data['extra'] = 'custom value';
    return $data;
});

// React to data being recorded
add_action('abovefold_data_recorded', function($insert_id, $data) {
    // Your custom logic here
}, 10, 2);
```

### Config Options (in `wp-config.php`)

```php
define('ABOVE_FOLD_DATA_RETENTION', 15); // Default is 7 days
define('ABOVE_FOLD_PURGE_LIMIT', 500);   // Default is 1000 records
```

## Final Notes

This project is still growing. The foundations are solid, the purpose is clear, and every file here was written with care—sometimes painfully, often joyfully. If you’ve ever built something because it *had* to exist, you’ll understand the spirit behind this.
